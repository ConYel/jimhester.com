    Open source R packages on GitHub often take advantage of continuous integration
    services to automatically check their packages for errors. This is very useful
    to catch things quickly, as well and increasing confidence for proposed
    changes, as the Pull Requests can be checked before they are merged. Travis-CI
    and Appveyor are the most popular current methods. However a newer service,
    GitHub Actions shows promise for being more powerful and
    simpler to configure and debug. I will discuss the use of GitHub Actions
    for R packages and demonstrate some of their capabilities and how to
    configure them for your own use in packages and reports.
