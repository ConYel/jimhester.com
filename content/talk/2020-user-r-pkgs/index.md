  Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable R functions, the
  documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. One of the strength of the R community is
  the large and varied packages available. Being able to create your own packages allows your work to be used
  by many more people than it could otherwise and can provide a major benefit to the community as a whole
  as well as your own personal collaborations.

  The key to well-documented, well-tested and easily-distributed R code is the package. This half day class
  will teach you how to make package development as easy as possible with devtools and usethis. You’ll also
  learn roxygen2 to document your code so others (including future you!) can understand what’s going on,
  and testthat to avoid future breakages.
  Learning outcomes: This class will be a good fit for you if you’ve developed a number of R scripts, and now
  you want to learn:

    - a more efficient workflow, iterating between writing code and checking that it works;
    - how to document your code so others (including future you!) can understand what’s going on;
    - automated testing principles, so that if you accidentally break something in your code you find out right away;
    - how to package and distribute your code to others, whether it’s inside your research group, your company, or to the whole world.

  Requirements: Participants should bring a laptop setup to build R packages. Detailed instructions are
  available [here](https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html).
