    Getting data into and out of databases is one of the most fundamental parts of data science. Much of the
    worldâ€™s data is stored in databases, including traditional databases such as SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL,
    and Oracle, as well as non-traditional databases like Hive, BigQuery, Redshift and Spark.
    The odbc package provides an R interface to [Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/microsoft-open-database-connectivity-odbc?view=sql-server-2017) drivers and databases
    including all those listed previously. odbc provides consistent output; including support for timestamps and
    64-bit integers, improved performance for reading and writing, and complete compatibility with the [DBI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=DBI)
    package.

    odbc connections can be used as [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr) backends, allowing one to perform expensive queries within the
    database and reduce the need to transfer and load large amounts of data in an R session. odbc is also
    integrated into the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), with dialogs to setup and establish connections, preview available tables
    and schemas and run ad-hoc SQL queries. The [RStudio Professional Products](https://www.rstudio.com/products/team/) are bundled with a suite of
    ODBC drivers, to make it easy for System Administrators to establish and support connections to a variety
    of database technologies.
