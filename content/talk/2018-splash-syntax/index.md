  R is a highly dynamic language with a long history of using syntax and
  language constructs to improve the usability, particularly in interactive
  use. Today the core of the R language is very stable and mature with tens of
  thousands of extension packages available and used by millions of people;
  which makes the addition of new syntax in R a challenge.
  However because R is so dynamic many improvements can be written in R packages
  without the need to modify the language itself. String interpolation with the
  glue package, piping with the magrittr package and tidy evaluation with the
  rlang package all added useful constructs to the R ecosystem without changes in
  base R.
  Extending this idea is the altparsers package, which allows the use of one or
  more alternative parsers to produce valid R code. This allows you to modify
  the syntax in ways not possible with the base parser while still avoiding the
  need to change the language syntax.
