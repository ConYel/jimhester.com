  This is a two-day hands on workshop designed for experienced R and RStudio
  users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. You’ll learn holistic workflows
  that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis. We’ll work
  on project-oriented workflows, version control for data science (Git/GitHub!),
  and how to plan for collaboration, communication, and iteration (incl.
  RMarkdown). In terms of your R skills, expect to come away with new knowledge
  of your R installation, how to maintain it, robust strategies for working with
  the file system, and ways to use the purrr package for repetitive tasks.

  You should take this workshop if you’ve been using R for a while and you feel
  like writing R code is not what’s holding you back the most. You’ve realized
  that you have more pressing “meta” problems that no one seems to talk about:
  how to divide your work into projects and scripts, how to expose your work to
  others, and how to get more connected to the R development scene. The tidyverse
  is not an explicit focus of the course (other than the purrr segment) and you
  can certainly work through the content without it. But you should expect a
  great deal of tidyverse exposure.

  This course is taught by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester.
