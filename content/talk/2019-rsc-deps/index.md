  Software dependencies can often be a double-edged sword. On one hand, they
  let you take advantage of others' work, giving your software marvelous new
  features and reducing bugs. On the other hand, they can change, causing your
  software to break unexpectedly and increasing your maintenance burden. These
  problems occur everywhere, in R scripts, R packages, Shiny applications and
  deployed ML pipelines. So when should you take a dependency and when should
  you avoid them? Well, it depends! This talk will show ways to weigh the pros
  and cons of a given dependency and provide tools for calculating the weights
  for your project. It will also provide strategies for dealing with dependency
  changes, and if needed, removing them. We will demonstrate these techniques
  with some real-life cases from packages in the tidyverse and r-lib.
