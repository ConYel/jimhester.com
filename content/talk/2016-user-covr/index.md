abstract: >
  Code coverage records whether or not each line of code in a package is
  executed by the package's tests. While it does not check whether a given
  program or test executes properly it does reveal areas of the code which are
  untested. Coverage has a long history in the computer science community (Miller
  and Maloney in Communications of the ACM, 1963), unfortunately the R language
  has lacked a comprehensive and easy to use code coverage tool. The covr package
  was written to make it simple to measure and report test coverage for R, C, C++
  and Fortran code in R packages. It has measurably improved testing for numerous
  packages and also serves as an informative indicator of package reliability.
  Covr is now used routinely by over 1000 packages on CRAN, Bioconductor and
  GitHub. I will discuss how covr works, how it is best used and how it has
  demonstrably improved test coverage in R packages since its release.
