  Getting data into and out of databases is one of the most fundamental parts of
  data science. Much of the world's data is stored in databases of various
  forms, including traditional databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server
  and Oracle, as well as NoSQL databases like BigQuery, Redshift and Spark.

  Modern methods using the odbc, pool and DBI packages make connecting, querying
  and retrieval from these diverse data sources concise, uniform and performant.
  Odbc provides a DBI interface to ODBC drivers, allowing fast access to a wide
  variety of ODBC compatible databases. Pool provides a fault-tolerant connection
  pool, very useful for use in shiny applications and web services. DBI allows
  interaction with any of these sources using a consistent interface.

  We will discuss the most effective ways to use these packages in a data
  analysis, shiny applications and production web services.
