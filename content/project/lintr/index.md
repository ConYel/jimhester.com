__lintr__ is an R package offering [static code analysis for
R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis). It checks adherence
to a given style, syntax errors and possible semantic issues.

Supports on the fly checking of R code edited with 'RStudio IDE', 'Emacs',
'Vim', 'Sublime Text' and 'Atom'.
