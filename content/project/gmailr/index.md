gmailr wraps the [Gmail REST API v3](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/).
It provides a variety of functions to query your mailbox and create and send
new email messages. You can retrieve, create and send emails and drafts, manage
email labels, trash and untrash emails, and delete messages, drafts and
threads.
