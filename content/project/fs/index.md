**fs** provides a cross-platform, uniform interface to file system
operations. It shares the same back-end component as
[nodejs](https://nodejs.org), the
[libuv](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/fs.html) C library, which brings
the benefit of extensive real-world use and rigorous cross-platform
testing. The name, and some of the interface, is partially inspired by
Rustâ€™s [fs module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/index.html).
