Code coverage is a measure of the amount of
code being exercised by a set of tests. It is an indirect measure of test
quality and completeness. This package is compatible with any testing
methodology or framework and tracks coverage of both R code and compiled
C/C++/FORTRAN code.

Today covr is the de-facto standard for tracking test coverage in the R
community, with nearly 1000 CRAN packages having covr as a reverse dependency,
and many more thousands using the package on GitHub.
