The **readr** package makes it easy to get rectangular data out of comma separated
(csv), tab separated (tsv) or fixed width files (fwf) and into R. It is
designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still
cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes. If you are new to readr, the
best place to start is the [data import
chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html) in R for data science.
