title: Using git clean filters to remove local path information.

<p>Error messages in many programming languages (including R) often have the full
paths to files included in the error message. (e.g.
“/Users/jhester/projects/pkgname/R/pkg.R”). This feature is very helpful when
working with a package locally as it makes it easy to find exactly what file
has an issue. However if these errors are included in documentation examples or
in check output the local directory information is extraneous and possibly
sensitive.</p>
<p>These output files could be modified by hand before committing them,
e.g. changing the above path to “…/R/pkg.R”. A script could be written to do it
automatically as well, but this still requires diligence to remember to run it
before committing files to the repository.</p>
<p>Instead, using <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#Keyword-Expansion">git clean and smudge
filters</a>
we can have git automatically sanitize our files before they are committed to
the repository.</p>
<div id="setting-up-a-clean-filter" class="section level1">
<h1>Setting up a clean filter</h1>
<p>First we need to write a script that takes input from standard input and writes
the cleaned output to standard output. In our case we want to substitute any text
that matches the current directory with <code>...</code>, which will remove the local
directory information. A simple perl script which does this is below (sanitize.pl)</p>
<pre class="perl"><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl

use Cwd;

my $cwd = getcwd();

while(&lt;&gt;) {
  s{$cwd}{...}g;
  print;
}</code></pre>
<p>Once we have this script we next need to tell git what file types we want to
run our filter on by adding it to a <code>.gitattributes</code> file. In this case we are
defining the filter for both markdown and HTML files.</p>
<pre><code>*.md filter=sanitize-paths
*.html filter=sanitize-paths</code></pre>
<p>If we want to use this only on the current repository it should be defined in a
<code>.gitattributes</code> file in the repository root. If however we want to define this
globally by setting the git config option <code>core.attributeFile</code> (by default this
will be <code>$HOME/.config/git/attributes</code>).</p>
<p>We then need to define the <code>sanitize-paths</code> filter above to use our
<code>sanitize.pl</code> file. In this case we are not using a smudge filter, so we do not
need to set it explicitly. If you only want this to be set for the local
repository remove <code>--global</code> from the command.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global filter.sanitize-paths.clean sanitize.pl</code></pre>
<p>With that we are done, Git will now automatically remove the path information
before we commit markdown and html files to any of our repositories!</p>
