title: Using a C level debugger in Rstudio

<p>I often use C level debuggers such as <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/">lldb</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/s/gdb/">gdb</a> when debugging R
packages with compiled code. If you are unfamiliar with doing this <a href="http://kevinushey.github.io/blog/2015/04/13/debugging-with-lldb/">Kevin Ushey
has an excellent
post</a> on the topic.
Usually bugs are reproducible both from the R terminal and RStudio. If this is
the case then running R under the debugger is easy; just start R from the
terminal with <code>R -d lldb</code>.</p>
<p>However more rarely there will be a bug that only occurs when the code is run
in <a href="http://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, and in these cases you would ideally like to
be able to attach to the internal RStudio Rsession process.</p>
<p>You can get the PID (process identifier) of any R process by calling <code>Sys.getpid()</code> from the
R console. Then you can have the debugger attach to this PID with the <code>-p</code>
argument to lldb, e.g. <code>lldb -p 45323</code>. However if you do this with the current
RStudio release (v1.1) you will get this!</p>

<p>I believe this occurs because of how RStudio detects if the R process
is still running. When the debugger interrupts internal rsession process
RStudio no longer thinks it has an active R session running, so shows the error
message.</p>
<p>However you can work around this by using a feature of lldb I hadn’t used until
encountering this problem, <code>--waitfor</code>. This allows you to have lldb attach to
a process (by name) as soon as it starts.</p>
<p>To do this first start lldb from a separate console (<code>lldb</code>). This will launch
you into the lldb prompt. Then tell lldb you would like to attach to the
rsession process using <code>--waitfor</code>.</p>
<pre><code>process attach --name rsession --waitfor</code></pre>
<p>lldb will then wait for this rsession process to start. Now we can start up
RStudio. The lldb session will then print something like the following</p>
<pre><code>Process 50879 stopped
* thread #1, queue = &#39;com.apple.main-thread&#39;, stop reason = signal SIGSTOP
    frame #0: 0x000000010085b4f8 rsession`rstudio_boost::filesystem::path::path&lt;char const*&gt;(char const*, char const*) + 88
rsession`rstudio_boost::filesystem::path::path&lt;char const*&gt;:
-&gt;  0x10085b4f8 &lt;+88&gt;: movb   %al, (%r13)
    0x10085b4fc &lt;+92&gt;: jmp    0x10085b50c               ; &lt;+108&gt;
    0x10085b4fe &lt;+94&gt;: movq   %r13, %rdi
    0x10085b501 &lt;+97&gt;: movq   %r12, %rsi
Target 0: (rsession) stopped.</code></pre>
<p>And the RStudio session will be stopped with RStudio only partially loaded. You can then
continue execution in lldb with <code>c</code> and the RStudio session will continue to load.
From here you can set breakpoints / interrupt execution as you normally would
when debugging with lldb.</p>
<p>While this process isn’t <em>too</em> cumbersome, it is certainly more work than is ideal, and
the workaround is somewhat esoteric. Luckily, RStudio 1.2+ (now available as a
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/">preview release</a>) makes this extra workaround unnecessary! In v1.2 you <em>can</em>
attach lldb directly to a running RStudio session without causing RStudio to
fail!</p>
<p>Thanks again to Jonathan McPherson and Kevin Ushey for their pointers on how get this
working for RStudio 1.1.</p>
