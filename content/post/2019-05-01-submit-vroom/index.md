Today I am going to be submitting my vroom package to CRAN, so I thought it
would be fun to do it as a demo, so you can see at least one part of this
mystical process.

It is possible to submit packages to CRAN via a web form, but today I will be
using some helper functions in the devtools and usethis packages to make it
even easier
