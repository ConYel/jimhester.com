<p>It is sometimes useful to have git tracking files stored in a different
location from your working directory, for instance if you would like to backup
the git files, and your working directory contains files which are much too
large to back up. This could be accomplished by using symlinks, however this
is a fairly fragile solution. A more robust solution is that given in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/505467/can-i-store-the-git-folder-outside-the-files-i-want-tracked">this
stackoverflow post</a>.</p>
<p>If you already have a git repository you would like to store outside the
working directory, say /path/to/repo.git and you are in the working directory</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>mv .git /path/to/repo.git
echo &quot;gitdir: /path/to/repo.git&quot; &gt; .git
git config --add worktree `pwd -P`</code></pre>
<p>This will move the .git folder to the new location, create a .git file pointing
to the new location, and update the git configuration to point to the current
working directory. Everything will then work exactly as it did before</p>
<p>If you are initializing a new empty repository you can do everything on one
line</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>git --git-dir=/path/to/repo.git --work.tree=`pwd -P` init &amp;&amp; \
  echo &quot;gitdir: /path/to/repo.git&quot; &gt; .git</code></pre>
<p>This is a very useful tip for keeping track of all of your repositories, and
also allows easy backup, as you can just mirror the folder which contains all
of them.</p>
