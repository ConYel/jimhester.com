A tour of the recently released vroom package (http://vroom.r-lib.org/)

vroom reads with a quick initial indexing step, then reads the values lazily,
so only the data you actually use needs to be read. The writer formats the data
in parallel and writes to disk asynchronously from formatting.

I go through an extensive tour of the package features and some more
sophisticated things you can do with the vroom package.
