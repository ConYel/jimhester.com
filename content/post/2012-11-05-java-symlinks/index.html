title: Commandline Java applications from symlinks

<p>I dislike java commandline tools for a number of reasons, including their typical
extreme verbosity in arguments and lack of one letter substitutes. Another
reason is that typically they do not have a simple shortcut which can be used
to run them, you have to do something ugly like</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>java -jar lib/blah/blue/file.jar other_arguments</code></pre>
<p>Even if the developer is nice enough to include a wrapping script they often
assume you will be running the program from the directory the java program
resides in. There is no way to run the program from your working directory.</p>
<p>However if java developers would simply use this idiom in their wrapping
scripts people could simply make a symlink to the wrapper and put it in their
PATH, and everything would work nicely.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>java -jar `dirname &quot;$(readlink -f $0)&quot;`/lib/blah/blue/file.jar other_arguments</code></pre>
