<div id="the-problem" class="section level2">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</a> is a great technique for both developers,
contributers and users to ensure that the development build of a project
remains in a working state. In the R community there are a few different CI
setups in use. The <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_summary.html">CRAN</a> and <a href="http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/devel/bioc-LATEST/">Bioconductor</a> package repositories
both run nightly build checks for all of their packages using custom build
servers. More recently continuous builds with <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/">Travis-CI</a> on
<a href="https://github.com">Github</a> repositories have grown in popularity.</p>
<p>I personally have found great utility of using Travis for my projects. <a href="https://github.com/jimhester/gmailr">Gmailr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinushey/rex">rex</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/jimhester/lintr">lintr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jimhester/covr">covr</a> all were developed using Travis and lintr and
covr were both conceived with continuous integration in mind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have found over time that builds on Travis have been taking
longer and longer in both queue time and runtime. I think is due to two main
points,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Travis has risen in popularity over the past few years and their build stack
has not kept pace.</li>
<li>The build environments for R projects have gotten more feature-full and take
longer to build.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point one will eventually happen to any CI system that gains popularity, but it
does show an advantage to using a less popular system. Point two occurs
largely due to a deficiency in the Travis build model. Travis’ container
support allows only their pre-built containers and you cannot use any sudo
commands in your build steps. R projects require somewhat heavy dependencies
to build (<a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/">Latex</a> being the largest culprit), and many package
dependencies have to be compiled from the source. As a result often a build
spends 90% or more of it’s time downloading and installing the dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="docker-containers" class="section level2">
<h2>Docker Containers</h2>
<p>One solution to this dependency problem is <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> containers. These
containers allow you to distribute an application stack as a self-contained and
standalone package. The benefit for using Docker containers for continuous
integration is that once you have downloaded the container for the first time,
subsequent builds using it become instantaneous.</p>
<p>Fortunately the R community has realized the utility of Docker containers and
maintains an up to date collection of R containers in the <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/rocker/">Rocker</a>
project. These containers contain all the necessary dependencies for both the
release versions of R as well as daily version of R-devel. In addition there
are containers with pre-installed packages from the <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/rocker/hadleyverse/">Hadleyverse</a> and
<a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/rocker/ropensci/">ROpenSci</a> projects. <a href="http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/devel/bioc-LATEST/">Bioconductor</a> also maintains a set of
<a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/">Docker Containers</a> based on the Rocker base which contain
pre-built Bioconductor packages. All of these containers can be found on the
<a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=rocker&amp;searchfield=">Docker Hub</a>, which is a large collection of community contributed
Docker containers.</p>
</div>
<div id="wercker" class="section level2">
<h2>Wercker</h2>
<p><a href="http://wercker.com/">Wercker</a> is described as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an open automation platform for developing, building and delivering your applications</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was historically based on a traditional build stack, however on April 2nd
they introduced a new <a href="http://blog.wercker.com/2015/04/02/Introducing-our-docker-stack.html?ref=producthunt">Docker based stack</a> which they call Ewok. This
allows you to use any Docker container hosted on Docker Hub as the base image
for your build.</p>
<p>Each Wercker build consists of a series of steps, which can be either
a series of shell commands to run or pre-defined steps from the
<a href="https://app.wercker.com/#explore">Step Registry</a>. Anyone can create a new step and add it to the
registry, and I have created a seriers of <a href="https://app.wercker.com/#search/steps/jimhester">steps for R</a>.</p>
<p>In addition because Wercker stores the results of the build as a Docker
container you can download them afterwards and inspect the results
(<code>wercker pull</code>). Builds can even be re-run locally under the same environment
as the build server using <code>wercker build</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-solution" class="section level2">
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>So using this new Docker based Ewok stack we can use a Rocker container and
have our dependencies nearly instantly after the first build!</p>
<p>Once you have the new Application setup in Wercker you simply can add the
following content to a <code>wercker.yml</code> file in your packages root directory.</p>
<p>{% highlight yaml %}
box: rocker/hadleyverse
build:
steps:
- jimhester/r-dependencies
- jimhester/r-check
- jimhester/r-lint
- jimhester/r-coverage
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>This will install all dependencies for your package, build and check it, run it
through lint the code with <a href="https://github.com/jimhester/lintr">lintr</a>, and generate code coverage with
<a href="https://github.com/jimhester/covr">covr</a> and upload the results to <a href="https://codecov.io">Codecov</a>.</p>
<p>For more detailed setup instructions please see <a href="https://github.com/jimhester/wercker-r-example">jimhester/wercker-r-example</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="custom-containers" class="section level2">
<h2>Custom Containers</h2>
<p>The above is already a large improvement over Travis builds, however perhaps your
package has a large package dependency which is not already present in the
Rocker or Bioconductor images. Never fear, you can simply create your
own custom image with the dependency installed and upload it to Docker Hub.
Then simply change the <code>box:</code> value in <code>wercker.yml</code> to the location of your
new image and get instant builds even with heavy dependencies!</p>
