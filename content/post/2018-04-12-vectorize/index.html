<p>I would first like to thank Dean Attali for writing the original post that
inspired this one. Creating vectorized functions is definitely a common problem
when dealing with vectors and creating functions in R and having public
discourse on the best ways to do this is great for the whole community, thanks
Dean!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/Vectorize">Vectorize</a> function is sometimes suggested as a solution to the problem of
iterating over elements of a vector, such as <a href="https://deanattali.com/blog/mutate-non-vectorized/">How to use dplyr’s mutate in R
without a vectorized function</a> by Dean Attali. This function at first
seems a perfect solution to this problem (automatically turn any function in a
vectorized one!). However like many things in life you may find it to be too
good to be true.</p>
<div id="are-you-sure-your-function-cannot-be-vectorized" class="section level2">
<h2>Are you <em>sure</em> your function cannot be vectorized?</h2>
<p>Many (most?) functions in base R and extension packages such as those in the
<a href="https://www.tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a> are vectorized over their primary arguments. To be vectorized means the
function works not just on a single value, but on the whole vector of values at
the same time.</p>
<p>Some examples of vectorized functions are <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/Arithmetic">+</a> and <a href="equality">==</a> and <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/NA">is.na()</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1:3 + 1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2 3 4</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>1:2 == 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE  TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>is.na(c(1, NA, 3))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE</code></pre>
<p>However even functions you may not first think are vectorized often are, such as <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/paste">paste()</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>color &lt;- c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;)
object &lt;- c(&quot;ball&quot;, &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;coat&quot;)
name &lt;- c(&quot;Sally&quot;, &quot;Hank&quot;, &quot;Darla&quot;)

paste(&quot;A&quot;, color, object, &quot;for&quot;, name)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;A blue ball for Sally&quot;  &quot;A red hat for Hank&quot;    
## [3] &quot;A green coat for Darla&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Often when people think they need to loop over elements their problem can
actually be rewritten to work with the already vectorized functions in R.</p>
<p>For instance Dean’s example function to perform the following task.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a path some/path/abc/001.txt, this function will return abc_001.txt</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
patient_name &lt;- function(path) {
  path_list &lt;- str_split(path, &quot;/&quot;) %&gt;% unlist()
  paste(path_list[length(path_list) - 1], path_list[length(path_list)], sep = &quot;_&quot;)
}

# Vectorize it with Vectorize
patient_name_v &lt;- Vectorize(patient_name)</code></pre>
<p>At first it seems like this code would require you to iterate element by element to
have a vectorized form. However note the <code>unlist()</code> in the implementation.
Often needing to <code>unlist()</code> is an indication that you are dealing with an already vectorized
function. This is true in this case, <code>stringr::str_split()</code> is vectorized over
its inputs. Knowing this we can use <code>vapply()</code> with the <code>tail()</code> function to
extract and then paste the rows.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>patient_name_better &lt;- function(path) {
  path_list &lt;- str_split(path, &quot;/&quot;)
  last_two &lt;- vapply(path_list, tail, character(2), 2)
  paste0(last_two[1, ], &quot;_&quot;, last_two[2, ])
}</code></pre>
<p>This is an improvement, the code is easier to read and while we have a loop in
the <code>vapply()</code> call, we are taking advantage of the vectorized <code>paste0()</code>.</p>
<p>However in this case an even better alternative is available. R has vectorized
functions <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/basename">basename()</a> and <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/basename">dirname()</a> to retrieve the
basename (filename) and directory name of a file path. So we can use these
directly along with <code>paste()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>patient_name_best &lt;- function(path) {
  paste0(basename(dirname(path)), &quot;_&quot;, basename(path))
}</code></pre>
<p>This gives us a very concise implementation and because all of these functions
are implemented directly in C this is also very fast.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Construct 100 paths
paths &lt;- rep(c(&quot;some/path/abc/001.txt&quot;, &quot;another/directory/xyz/002.txt&quot;), 100)

res &lt;- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  patient_name_v(paths),
  patient_name_better(paths),
  patient_name_best(paths)
)

bench &lt;- summary(res)[c(&quot;expr&quot;, &quot;median&quot;)]
bench</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                         expr    median
## 1      patient_name_v(paths) 18824.948
## 2 patient_name_better(paths)  1162.661
## 3   patient_name_best(paths)   159.825</code></pre>
<p>In this simple case the median runtime is 16x faster for the better version and
117x faster for the best version!</p>

<div id="but-what-if-my-problem-really-cannot-use-vectorized-functions" class="section level2">
<h2>But what if my problem really cannot use vectorized functions?</h2>
<p>There are cases where your code really cannot be rewritten in this way, so
is <code>Vectorize()</code> a good solution in that case? I argue no it is not, for the
following reasons.</p>
<div id="vectorize-does-not-generate-type-stable-functions." class="section level3">
<h3>Vectorize does not generate type stable functions.</h3>
<p>The function generated by <code>Vectorize</code> wraps the input function in a call to
<code>mapply()</code> under the hood, with the default argument <code>SIMPLIFY = TRUE</code>. This
means the type of the function output depends on the input. For example</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Everything seems good, character vector output
patient_name_v(&quot;some/path/abc/001.txt&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## some/path/abc/001.txt 
##         &quot;abc_001.txt&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># But now my output is a named list()!
patient_name_v(character())</code></pre>
<pre><code>## named list()</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># And now it is a list with no names!
patient_name_v(NULL)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## list()</code></pre>
<p>Type stability is also the reason it is best to avoid <code>sapply()</code> or <code>mapply()</code>
in favor of the type stable <code>vapply()</code> or <code>purrr::map_*()</code> and
<code>purrr::pmap_*()</code> functions.</p>
<p>You can call <code>Vectorize(SIMPLIFY = FALSE)</code> when you generate the vectorized
function, but this will cause the function to return a list of values rather
than a vector. Because many vectorized functions do not work with list inputs,
this often means you will then need to post-process your output.</p>
</div>
<div id="vectorize-does-not-generate-functions-with-easily-inspect-able-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Vectorize does not generate functions with easily inspect-able code</h3>
<p>Because of the way <code>Vectorize()</code> generates the function all generated functions
have the same body when printed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>patient_name_v</code></pre>
<pre><code>## function (path) 
## {
##     args &lt;- lapply(as.list(match.call())[-1L], eval, parent.frame())
##     names &lt;- if (is.null(names(args))) 
##         character(length(args))
##     else names(args)
##     dovec &lt;- names %in% vectorize.args
##     do.call(&quot;mapply&quot;, c(FUN = FUN, args[dovec], MoreArgs = list(args[!dovec]), 
##         SIMPLIFY = SIMPLIFY, USE.NAMES = USE.NAMES))
## }
## &lt;environment: 0x7fcb24915508&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This means you lose the easy inspectibility of functions. Being able to easily
see the implementation of functions in R is one of the strengths of the
ecosystem. So losing this behavior makes your functions much more difficult for
users (or yourself in the future) to understand. It <em>is</em> possible to retrieve
the original function definition, but doing so requires you to examine how
<code>Vectorize()</code> works; by storing the function in a variable called <code>FUN</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>environment(patient_name_v)$FUN</code></pre>
<pre><code>## function(path) {
##   path_list &lt;- str_split(path, &quot;/&quot;) %&gt;% unlist()
##   paste(path_list[length(path_list) - 1], path_list[length(path_list)], sep = &quot;_&quot;)
## }
## &lt;bytecode: 0x7fcb24eeeeb0&gt;</code></pre>

<div id="vectorize-functions-use-do.call-which-can-have-unexpected-performance-consequences" class="section level3">
<h3>Vectorize functions use <code>do.call()</code>, which can have unexpected performance consequences</h3>
<p>This is best explained by Hadley Wickham in <a href="http://rpubs.com/hadley/do-call2" class="uri">http://rpubs.com/hadley/do-call2</a>,
but the gist is <code>do.call()</code> ends up doing a lot more work than you might expect
and in some cases has performance implications, although in this particular
case they will be of minor concern. So because all functions generated with <code>Vectorize()</code> use <code>do.call()</code> they inherit these issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="vectorize-does-not-actually-make-your-code-execute-faster" class="section level3">
<h3>Vectorize does not actually make your code execute faster</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most important reason is that <code>Vectorize()</code> will not make your code
faster. People often want to vectorize their function because they have observed that vectorized functions are fast. This is usually true,
however it is true not because they are vectorized, but because vectorized
functions are often written in C code (or call other functions which are).
<code>Vectorize()</code> essentially just wraps your code in a loop and runs it
repeatedly, so it cannot improve the running time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="so-what-should-i-do" class="section level2">
<h2>So what should I do?</h2>
<p>Because of these issues I think a cleaner solution is first, try to rewrite
your function to take advantage of existing vectorized functions. If that is
not possible define your original function in an internal helper, which then
calls the equivalent type stable <code>map_()</code> or <code>vapply()</code> function on the
original function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>patient_name2 &lt;- function(path) {
  patient_name_one &lt;- function(path) {
    path_list &lt;- str_split(path, &quot;/&quot;) %&gt;% unlist()
    paste(path_list[length(path_list) - 1], path_list[length(path_list)], sep = &quot;_&quot;)
  }
  vapply(patient_name_one, path, character(1))
}</code></pre>
<p>This takes only a few more lines of code than the original and solves the
majority of the issues with <code>Vectorize()</code>. The function is now type stable for
all inputs, the function body remains inspectable and you avoid the potential
pitfalls of using <code>do.call()</code>.</p>
<p>In Dean’s original case he was trying to use <code>patient_name</code> in a call to
<code>dplyr::mutate()</code>. Rather than using <code>Vectorize()</code> to generate a new function
in this case I would instead suggest an idiom like the following.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- data_frame(path = paths)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: `data_frame()` is deprecated, use `tibble()`.
## This warning is displayed once per session.</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>df %&gt;% mutate(name = map_chr(path, patient_name))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 200 x 2
##    path                          name       
##    &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;chr&gt;      
##  1 some/path/abc/001.txt         abc_001.txt
##  2 another/directory/xyz/002.txt xyz_002.txt
##  3 some/path/abc/001.txt         abc_001.txt
##  4 another/directory/xyz/002.txt xyz_002.txt
##  5 some/path/abc/001.txt         abc_001.txt
##  6 another/directory/xyz/002.txt xyz_002.txt
##  7 some/path/abc/001.txt         abc_001.txt
##  8 another/directory/xyz/002.txt xyz_002.txt
##  9 some/path/abc/001.txt         abc_001.txt
## 10 another/directory/xyz/002.txt xyz_002.txt
## # … with 190 more rows</code></pre>
<p>This is similarly concise to using <code>Vectorize()</code> but is also type stable for all possible
inputs.</p>
