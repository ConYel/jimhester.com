I am a Software Engineer at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com), where I work on
Hadley Wickham's team developing open source R packages for the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [r-lib](https://github.com/r-lib)
projects.

I use my knowledge of R, C++ and other languages to build useful, correct, and
performant R packages.

My background is in bioinformatics and heathcare data science, I worked in the
[Genomic Medicine Institute](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/genomics) at the [Cleveland Clinic](https://ccf.org/), [Explorys Inc.](http://explorys.com), and on the [Bioconductor
core team](https://www.bioconductor.org/) before joining
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to work on the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
